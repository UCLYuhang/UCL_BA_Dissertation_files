<p>PRODUIT<br>

","<p>Founded less than 3 years ago and having already conquered 50% of French pharmacies, Faks' growth since 2020 is unprecedented.</p>
<p>We have set ourselves a mission: to simplify the pharmacist/laboratory relationship. Each pharmacist has more than 100 suppliers, which makes it difficult to manage: for example, they receive more than 200 emails per day and dozens of calls, in addition to physical appointments.</p>
<p>Faced with this situation, Faks is rethinking the traditional model of pharmacist/laboratory relations with a mobile app that centralises exchanges, making them simpler, more reliable and transparent.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Faks mobile app<br>
-** 10,000 French pharmacies** can delegate their supplier disputes, out-of-date information and promotional offers<br>
- The entire sales force of pharmaceutical companies in France uses the app in order to concentrate on high value-added tasks (promotion of new content, training of the pharmacy team, etc.)</p>
