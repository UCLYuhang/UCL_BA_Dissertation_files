I am excited to submit my application for the Sales position at Hongkong EGA Commercial Limited in London. As a marketing, sales, and communication manager with almost two years of experience managing marketing, sales, PR, and communications for AtenaClinic, I have successfully developed brand identity and visibility online. I have implemented marketing strategies such as email campaigns to segments of the market, planned marketing campaigns and strategies using strategic marketing techniques, and designed email campaigns, social media posts, and other marketing materials.
My successful email marketing campaign increased open rates by 20% and click-through rates by 15%. I used data-driven market segmentation to create email marketing campaigns and newsletters for specific customers. Additionally, I launched a new social media campaign that increased Atena Clinic’s Instagram and Facebook followers by 27% in the first month.
As the founder of IRM, I have experience working in e-commerce, managing shipping hubs in the US and Europe, and handling buy and sell transactions for financial instruments on behalf of private and business customers. I achieved eBay's top-rated seller status through excellent customer service and quality products and delivery, increasing product visibility by 83%. My digital marketing and advertising strategy led to a 34% increase in product sales, and I improved the quality of listings through professional photography and marketing strategies, boosting views by 47%.
As a Translation Specialist at Theben, I evaluated translations against source documentation to validate work accuracy, revised and translated materials to improve word choice and refine meanings, and translated email campaigns and newsletters. At Elite Studios, I increased Instagram engagement by 70% through ongoing interaction with hashtags, tagged photos and competitors' customers, developed influencer and UGC campaigns to generate new leads, and optimized social media profiles, boosting profile views by 87% within 2 months.
In my most recent role as a Communications Manager at ESN Erasmus Student Network, I localized PR initiatives to maximize regional awareness and coverage, developed and delivered integrated social media campaigns, and collaborated with SU to commission high-quality content such as pictures, videos, and posters. I also monitored the narrative surrounding the organization's developments and organized scheduled opportunities for external coverage for spokespeople.

As the CEO's assistant and salesperson at EL TEAM, I relieved the CEO's burden of administrative duties, delivered comprehensive support to the CEO through itinerary planning, conflict de-escalation, and managing correspondence, and promptly processed mail, email, and phone inquiries, minimizing correspondence backlogs.
With my experience in sales, marketing, and communication, as well as my proficiency in digital marketing and advertising, CRM database management, and market segmentation, I am confident that I can make a valuable contribution to Hongkong EGA Commercial Limited. 

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing my qualifications further.

Sincerely,
Tomas Habryka

He has a Driving license.

","I am Bulgarian born and bred, and agriculture is in my blood. My grandfather was a landowner and a wheat and corn farmer, and I have spent time with him during harvest season on a number of occasions. Now that my grandfather is gone, my father is managing the land while being a part time vet. He’s been growing wheat only for the last couple of years but he is planning on diversifying next year, and he’s reaching out to me for business advice quite often.

The strong affinity I have with nature and agriculture stemming from my upbringing, paired with my extensive experience in sales and business development give me strong foundation to build on with Hyperplan. In my experience I only need to be an expert on the problems the product I sell is solving in order for me to be able to add value to a business conversation. I am a keen and curious learner, and need no more than a couple of months of reading daily on a matter for me to be able to discuss it with C-suites, critically and creatively.

In short, my personal and professional backgrounds have equipped with the mind and skillset needed for me to be a success in position of Business Development Manager at Hyperplan. I hope you are open to a conversation where we can see if we are the right culture fit for each other.

Best,
Yann

En 2017, il a eu l'opportunité d'évoluer vers un poste de CTO, gérant plusieurs équipes techniques, le développement stratégique et la définition et le développement de logiciels.

- No experience in startup
","- Very good technical skills
",,,"Filipe is a CTO who works at Hispatec which is a Spanish tech company that develops tailor-made software for its agri-food customers in Spain and abroad (14 m€ turnover)

He specializes in process efficiency in very mature activities that need to earn a few % margins.

He has experience in programming and IOT which seems interesting. It remains to dig into what it can do vs what Verti needs in detail.

The subject is that he does not really have an appetite for entrepreneurship. He is more open to opportunities… He has no startup experience either.

He sees AI as more marketing than a powerful technological tool.

He does not really have an appetite for Vertical Farming even if he is interested in coming to Cartagena to see our technology and continue discussions.

In conclusion, I would say that we can work with Filipe but he is not the ideal candidate mainly because he does not have the “startup” mindset.

We have to debrief with Olivier tomorrow morning and we'll tell you if we'll rule him out for good.

At this stage, I would like to receive more solid profiles on the startup experience anyway.

His career in agriculture started in the Operations field, for the Sanlucar Group (2010-2013), where he led the citrus or stone fruit processes in South Africa for the Spanish producer, covering technological needs with external partners.
In Agromillora (2016-2020), he set up a subsidiary in Peru to implement a plant nursery on substrate, he took all the necessary information and registered, looking for a local partner. After 4 years they had 3 partners who did not remain in the project, so the project was closed. In the meantime, he worked in nursery quality improvements in California.
Currently, he works as Analytics & Data Driven Business Development for Hispatec (fusion of 2 startups), to take charge of the technological implementation applied to agriculture. They develop SW projects where they incorporate agricultural development and technical advice.
 
Entrepreneurial spirit: He has always worked on uncertain projects, where the risk is high, and his function was to manage to stabilize them, despite having worked mostly for large companies, with projects financed by them, but which involved constant risk and innovation. Specifically, his current company is the fusion of 2 startups and during his pass in Citricom he developed the same tasks that he would have in Verti: he has to open the office from scratch, do everything by himself as he didn’t have any team, was in charge of choosing the machines and monitoring the data necessaries for the citric trees.
 
Knowledge of vertical farming/greenhouse hydroponic: For 4 years in Agromillora, part of the plants were grown on a substrate, which was basically hydroponic, so the water needed to carry the minerals and nutrients that the plant needs. Regarding vertical farming, knows that it is an innovative trend, actively participates in technology and agricultural robotics forums.
 
Do you have Knowledge in Web developing and B2B marketplace, technologies, monitoring, farm management platform and connected devices (IOT) etc.: He has never done it at a professional level, but, he has done basic things in a personal capacity and used it to present projects. He could make the website and the Marketplace for Verti, but then in the near future someone specialized would have to take over. Monitoring crops is what he currently does, with the necessary resources he would feel very comfortable doing it.

**Residence:** La Puebla, Cartagena
## **Comments:**
He currently works as CTO in a laboratory (LABORATORIO QUÍMICO MICROBIOLOGICO (by GBA GROUP), Sector Chemical agrifood, materials and environmental analysis) that has experienced a merger, his laboratory was bought by a larger one and the acquisition will be completed in 5 years. In principle, his charge will not change, but it is still unstable. He personally is not afraid of the start-up world, because he has founded some and knows what it is to live with it. He is old enough to start working on a challenge such as someone else's startup, he already knows the risks, and he really likes Verti's business.
He has been working in a lab for a long time, where he leads a very junior team, so he has to do everything from making technical decisions to coding. Furthermore, he likes to offer in-house technical solutions to problems that arise in the lab.
Currently, he works almost 95% remotely. He agrees to a hybrid position at Verti, as it is very close to his house.
","**Entrepreneurial spirit**: he would need to know the objectives and budgets to change, he is a man who likes to take risks, but with knowledge.
**Knowledge of vertical farming/greenhouse hydroponic:** he knows something on a personal level, he is immersed in the world of agriculture because his clients in the laboratory are from agriculture. He is used to taking quality levels, and in a personal way, automatic irrigation and temperature control in his home.
**Do you have Knowledge in Web developing and B2B marketplace, technologies, monitoring, farm management platform and connected devices (IOT) etc.:** He personally owns an orchard and bonsai, where he took charge of automatic irrigation and temperature control. Web development MySQL, HTML, PHP, JavaScript, also with C, Python, he has knowledge of algorithms, so he adapts easily. With IOT he has worked on a personal level and in the laboratory monitoring the temperature in the ovens, all the information goes to a cloud where he can program what he programs himself. 
## **Other Questions:**
**1.) Do you enjoy working in a company where Spanish/French are the day-to-day communication language?** Yes
**2.) French:** now is basic, need to practice
**3.) Spanish:** mother tongue
**4.) English:** fluent
**5.) Reason for changing**: open to take risks.
**6.) Other recruitment processes**: no, but open to the market.

Depuis 2002, il est directeur informatique à la CRCC (Campo de Cartagena Irrigation Community), dans le secteur agricole de la Mar Menor. 
Il a beaucoup d'expérience dans le domaine de la sensorisation et a personnellement étudié l'hydroponie. En outre, il a travaillé en tant qu'indépendant pour aider les petites entreprises à automatiser l'irrigation et d'autres activités liées à l'agriculture.

Ils appliquent les BigData dans le domaine de la demande, mais il souhaite innover dans le domaine de l'irrigation, car l'innovation n'est pas un point fort de l'entreprise. D'autre part, en raison de la proximité de la Mar Menor, l'utilisation du sol est limitée à cause de la contamination, c'est pourquoi l'agriculture verticale et hydroponique est l'option pour l'avenir de la région. 
Il a beaucoup de contacts avec les autres agriculteurs et peut utiliser ses connaissances pour le développement de Verti.

Dans le secteur, il s'est rendu compte qu'il n'y a pas beaucoup d'entreprises qui travaillent dans le domaine de l'agriculture verticale, même si beaucoup en parlent et font des études. La croissance est donc exponentielle. Le fait d'être situé à Cartagena est un atout, en raison de la lumière du soleil, il n'y a pas besoin de beaucoup d'argent pour installer des panneaux solaires et résoudre le problème que représente l'agriculture verticale en ce qui concerne l'énergie.

Résidence : Murcie, se rend à Cartagena presque tous les jours.
Jours de préavis : 15 jours  à 1 mois.
","Jours de préavis : 15 jours à un mois.
Salaire attendu : 65.000€
Résidence : Murcie, voyage à Cartagena presque tous les jours.
Expérience dans des rôles similaires dans des startups : Le CRCC et ses clients indépendants travaillent depuis longtemps à l'interconnexion de systèmes qui ne fonctionnent pas nécessairement bien ensemble. Ils ont choisi une norme de travail qui est comprise avec de nombreuses technologies, afin d'être en mesure d'ajouter et de croître.
 
Connaissance de l'agriculture verticale/des serres hydroponiques : au moins 10 ans dans le domaine de l'hydroponie.

Avez-vous des connaissances en matière de développement Web et de marché B2B, de technologies, de surveillance, de plateforme de gestion agricole et d'appareils connectés (IOT), etc : Au CRCC, il a réalisé presque la moitié du développement de ce qu'ils utilisent, il s'occupe des langages de bas et de haut niveau. Il a de l'expérience dans la création de sites web, bien qu'il pense qu'avec des technologies telles que wordpress, il pourrait créer un site web très rapidement et sans trop d'efforts ou de temps.
1.) Aimez-vous travailler dans une entreprise où l'espagnol et le français sont les langues de communication quotidiennes ? Oui, il préfère l'espagnol
2.) Français : aucun
3.) Espagnol : langue maternelle
4.) Anglais : courant
5.) Raison du changement :
 il aimerait un site où il peut innover et relever des défis dès le début du projet en appliquant le BigData et la technologie qui peut être développée en fonction des besoins de l'entreprise.

6.) Autres processus de recrutement : non, mais ouvert au marché.

","The answers to the first two questions are so specific and include market-related know-how. 

I will explain the answers but deeper strategies can be delivered once the onboarding is done. 


1- The main need is to provide Trust. Besides the reward system, a trust model should be built to cover long-term community & Brand bonds. 

2- Simplicity. Show your target audience how simple/great it is with Mangrove, and support it with KOLs who have an organic follower audience. Do spaces with KOLs, join podcasts, and build a multi-channel community system. Support the overall management with Reddit, and empower it with known and loved KOLs. 

3- Mangrove should use an ambassador system to get news and go into action asap. Any event that includes polygon and other supported chains should be considered and the workforce should be divided to attend all. Making the progress known is super simple. Subreddits and related topics can be fulfilled with true information by our ambassadors. 

Plus remote, global known events should be also considered. The most efficient ones should be selected and attended as sponsors if possible.

**How many years experience in R&D, start up and IVD:** I have 10 years of experience. I created 2 start-ups (1) whose technologies did not exist. So I had to recruit and manage 2 very different R&D teams. This has made it possible to obtain worldwide patents. I have 2 experiences in In Vitro Diagnostics: 
1. - with Cityzen, the connected textile, especially when Thomas PESQUET (the astronaut) was sent into space with our d-shirt. 
2. - with France Chimie, spin-off of MEDEF (national confederation of French employers), because many laboratories use it, such as the CNRS (National Centre for Scientific Research).
**How many people have you managed direct and indirect, what is your leadership style:** I managed up to 40 engineers, spread across France, Japan and the United States for Cityzen. For France Chemistry, I manage teams of clients, on 12 subjects. My leadership style is quite simple: I am close to my teams that I put forward and that I increase in competence, while being demanding. On the other hand, if there is a problem, in front of the customer, it is me who assumes the delay / error. I am fair enough and I recognize my limitations and my wrongs...

**What has been your greatest achievement: **my greatest achievement is certainly the creation of the Shetters technology: indeed, Essilor's Director of Global R&D (World leader in prescription lenses) told me that the technology I wanted was impossible to create.
**The reason for being attracted to this role: **the position your client offers is a diplomatic challenge (due to current geopolitics), intercultural (I want to work with people of Chinese culture) and commercial. In addition, your ad spoke of an 'excellent package'. 
By the way, when you asked me my salary, I answered in 'net' because I do not know if there is, or not, a company car for example. As you know, I can start immediately and I can work from home without any problems. I'm 'plug and play'
